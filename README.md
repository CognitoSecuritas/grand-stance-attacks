## 📄 Abstract
This paper introduces and formalizes a novel class of AI vulnerability termed **"Grand Stance" attacks**—a form of **procedural cognitive hijacking**. We demonstrate how an adversary can systematically steer an AI's cognitive framework through multi-turn, socially compliant dialogue, inducing **narrative bloating** by exploiting the resource competition between the AI's social intelligence and its safety monitoring. This work argues for a paradigm shift from static content safety to dynamic **cognitive process security**.

## 🚀 Core Contributions
1.  **Formalizes the “Grand Stance” dynamics model**, a framework for analyzing attack vectors across identity, affect, relationship, and coherence dimensions.
2.  **Identifies “narrative bloating”** as the core failure mechanism, rooted in computational resource competition.
3.  **Critiques the static alignment paradigm** from a philological and semiotic perspective.
4.  **Proposes “Cognitive Security”** as a new direction focusing on the robustness of the AI's cognitive process itself.
